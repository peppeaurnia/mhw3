        <span class="flex-itemcentral3">
            A long alley in the yard, a few flowers, a coffee table, a borrowed coffee machine and two chairs under the inscription Jungle Cafe. That’s how we started in April 2012. I, Daniel, aimed to start a business where people will meet, taste original dishes, drink quality and fragrant coffee, and above all, where they will feel good. <br><br>
            I relied on my 20-year year experience as a qualified chef, a passion for coffee, and perhaps, empathy and love for good people. From my travels in South America, I found my desire to be surrounded by nature, flowers and plants, and wanted to put this desire into a cafe, and that’s how the jungle cafe was born. <br><br>
            Jungle Cafe is proud and fortunate to have a team from all over the world. Team members with an open heart, and who agreed with my vision of a “good business”, enabling us to enrich each other – both humanly and professionally. The team, who I am so grateful for, share the same values as me, and that has helped us build the quality and reputation of our cafe.<br><br>
            Thanks to our team, you can feel the power, taste and aroma of espresso with perfectly whipped milk, taste the excellent and healthy flavours, and enjoy the relaxed and informal environment of Jungle Cafe.
